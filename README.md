# Skin Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This is a project I worked on to detect different types of skin diseases from images.  
I used the **ISIC dataset** and added a few steps to improve the model, like:

- **Digital hair removal** (since a lot of images had hair that interfered with the model).  
- **Data augmentation** to make the model more robust.  
- Tried different **CNN architectures** and tuned hyperparameters to get better accuracy.  
- Added **Grad-CAM** for explainability, so itâ€™s easier to see which part of the image the model is focusing on while predicting.  

The main goal of this project was not just accuracy but also making the predictions more **interpretable and useful in real-world scenarios**.
